# Story

Story is a beautiful [Hugo theme](https://gohugo.io) for showcasing your writing
and presentations. There's a robust [demo site](https://story.xaprb.com/) where you can see its
many features in action, and learn more about how to use them. You can also see Story in use on a real site by [Baron Schwartz](https://www.xaprb.com/).

Story is targeted to technical writers and
speakers: people such as software engineers and open source developers, who want a
website for their technical work, such as blogging about software
engineering. It's a great way to share your writing and speaking with the world.

It has a lot of features for people who invest effort in their websites and blogs!

- Beautiful, responsive typography for long-form content on screen and in print, including blogs, essays, and single pages.
- Support for [RemarkJS slides](https://remarkjs.com/).
- LaTeX math typesetting with [KaTeX](https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX)
- A built-in search page with [LunrJS](https://github.com/olivernn/lunr.js).
- Music notation typesetting with [abcjs](https://abcjs.net/).
- Easy-to-use, backwards-compatible Markdown enhancements such as ways to control image behavior (size, float, etc) with CSS.

This is just a fraction of Story's feature set, see the [demo site](https://story.xaprb.com/) for much more
documentation and screenshots.
