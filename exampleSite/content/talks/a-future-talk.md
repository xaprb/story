Story's talks pages can highlight upcoming appearances, promoting your talks
before you present. This is a dummy page illustrating this capability.

You'll have to add `buildFuture: true` to your site's `config.yaml` to enable
this setting.  Talks pages that are in the future won't appear on the homepage
or in your RSS feeds; they'll only appear in the `/talks/` list page of your
site.
